I have assembled a "Collective Work" of Creative Commons licensed Mandarin audio.  Note that the audio in the ``chinese_lessons``, ``sinoslipce``, and ``forvo`` directories all have a "Noncommercial" term applied and cannot be used for commercial purposes (however the three "Shtooka" audio collections don't have a "Noncommercial" term applied).  As of 2017-07-03 it can be downloaded from this `Dropbox link <https://u14129277.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14129277/cc_mandarin_audio_pack.zip>`_.  Most rights reside with authors of the separate and independent Works which constitute this Collective Work.  Any residual rights from the assembling of this Collective Work are released under a `CC0 license <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode>`_.  This Collective Work contains audio from the following sources:
